### About

Plugable PHP Validator is a validator mechanism based on Observer Pattern implementing various design patterns to decouple the code at its maximum.
Implementing Template Design Pattern to allow the stand-alone use of each validator model.

The validator does not force you to use a library as a whole, rather allows you to pick distinct pieces (perhaps the best of) validator.
The validation methods and ways will be explained below at a later stage.
